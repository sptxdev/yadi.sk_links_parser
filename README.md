Yadi.sk links parser
====================

A simple parser for yadi.sk links in the html files.

Use:
--------------------
For Windows a launcher is included which contains nothing more than a:

python yadi.sk_links_parser.py
pause

This will work on the html files in the current directory.

The output is in the form of 2 files:
 - a text file with links
 - a launcher for the links to be opened in Chrome.
